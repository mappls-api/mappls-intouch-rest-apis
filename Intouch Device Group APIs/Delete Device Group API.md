# Delete Device Group API

## **Introduction**

The *`Delete Device Group API`* offers a quick and effective way to remove unwanted or obsolete device groups from your platform. With a simple DELETE request, you can permanently delete a specific device group using its unique group ID. This API is perfect for maintaining a clean, organized environment by eliminating device groups that are no longer necessary, ensuring that your platform remains streamlined and up to date.

Whether you need to clear up unused groups or perform administrative cleanup, this API gives you the power to manage your device groups efficiently.

## **Security Type**
This API follows OAuth2 based security. To know more on how to create your authorization tokens, please use our authorization token URL. More details available [here](https://github.com/mappls-api/mappls-rest-apis/tree/main/mappls-token-generation-api).

## **Request Headers**

The API leverages OAuth 2.0 based security. Hence, the developer would need to send a request for access token using their client_id and client_secret to the OAuth API. Once validated from the OAuth API, the access_token and the token_type need to be sent as Authorization header with the value: **`"{token_type} {access_token}”`.**

- **Authorization: `{token_type} {access_token}.`**
- **Content-Type Header:** *`Optional, Not required for this API unless sending body data.`*
