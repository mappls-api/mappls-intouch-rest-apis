# Intouch Geofence APIs

The Intouch Geofence APIs provide a comprehensive solution for creating, managing, and monitoring geofences. With these APIs, users can define geofences of various geometries like circles or polygons and fetch details of single or multiple geofences, whether configured or newly created. Updates to existing geofences are supported to refine boundaries or attributes, while geofences can also be deleted as needed.

Additionally, the APIs allow tracking of device activities within geofences, such as entry and exit times, offering valuable insights across a defined timeframe. These capabilities make the APIs ideal for fleet management, access control, and location-based monitoring.
